# ViewQL(View Oriented Query Language)
ViewQL is an innovative approach to designing and developing flexible and adaptive multi-model databases.
## Introduce
ViewQL is a programming language for the virtual world of data. In which programmers are not limited to the relational paradigm of the SQL language, but can create a variety of conceptual models of virtual databases, including table, network, graph and hierarchical structures, to reflect specific problem areas. <BR>
ViewQL automatically materializes the created virtual databases into a real database while ensuring data integrity. <BR>
ViewQL has a wide range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for modeling and programming virtual databases. ViewQL's declarative syntax allows you to focus on what you want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it.
## Key features of the ViewQL language:
### Conceptual modeling allows you to:
* Create a variety of conceptual models, including tabular, network, graph, and hierarchical structures, to reflect specific problem areas.
* Define VIEWs as fundamental building blocks that represent entities and their properties from different angles.
* Establish connections between VIEWs to create different conceptual models.
### Database creation:
* Automatic materialization of the database schema when creating conceptual models, eliminating manual table definitions.
* ViewQL can automatically create relationships between views based on a conceptual model, simplifying data management and ensuring data consistency.
### Data manipulation allows you to:
* Extract, insert, update, and delete data with intuitive VIEW-based operations.
* Use a full set of commands to seamlessly interact with your data.
### Declarative syntax allows you to:  
* Focus on what you want to achieve, not how to achieve it.
* Express your intentions regarding the data clearly and concisely.
* ViewQL handles the major challenges for you.
## Main advantages:
### The ViewQL language can be used in a variety of applications, including:
* Application Development. ViewQL can be used to develop applications that require flexible and visual representation of data.
* Data Analysis. ViewQL can be used to analyze data such as business data or scientific data.
* Data Management. ViewQL can be used to manage data within an organization.
* Social Media. The ViewQL language can be used to develop social networks.
* Computer game development. The ViewQL language can be used to develop real-time computer games.
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. The ViewQL language can be used to create artificial intelligence and machine learning models.
* Microservice applications. ViewQL allow each microservice to have its own database view that can be replaced or added along with the microservice.
* Multi-agent applications. ViewQL allow each agent to have its own database view that can be used to share information with other agents.
ViewQL is an innovative approach to designing and developing flexible and adaptive multi-model databases.* Big Data Applications Views enable you to efficiently process large amounts of data by combining data from different views.
__Real Database:__ This is a collection of views of a real database from different perspectives. (A VIEWPOINT database is created automatically when you create database views.) The real database is transparent to the user.
CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on database view data automatically change the state of the actual database in real time.
