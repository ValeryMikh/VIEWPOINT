## IDE ADMIN provides a convenient and intuitive interface for performing the following tasks:

* __Modeling:__ Creating and editing data structures, defining relationships between them, and creating views.
* __Design:__ Developing the logical and physical structure of the database.
* __Programming:__ Writing scripts in ViewQL to automate routine operations and create complex queries.
* __Testing:__ Checking the correctness of the database and debugging errors.

## Key features of IDE ADMIN:

* __Query entry window:__ Allows you to enter ViewQL commands to create, modify, and delete database objects, as well as to execute queries against data.
* __Batch mode:__ Supports batch entry of commands, which speeds up the process of creating and modifying a database.
* __Visualization of results:__ The ANSWER window displays the results of query execution in an easy-to-understand form, providing opportunities for further analysis and processing of data.
* __Context menus:__ Provide quick access to the most frequently used functions and commands depending on the selected object (containers, views, tables, records).
* __Support for various data types:__ Allows you to work with various data types, including numeric, text, dates and times, as well as more complex data structures.

## The process of working with IDE ADMIN

* __Creating a new database:__ The user enters a script in ViewQL in the query entry window, describing the structure of the database.
* __Editing an existing database:__ The user can change the structure of the database, add or delete objects, modify data.
* __Executing queries:__ The user enters SQL-like queries to select, update and delete data.
* __Analysis of results:__ The user views the results of query execution in the ANSER window and performs further data processing.

## Benefits of using IDE ADMIN:

* __Improved developer productivity:__ Automation of routine tasks, reduction of development and debugging time.
* __Improve data quality:__ Ensure data integrity and consistency.
* __Simplify collaboration:__ Provide a single environment for multiple developers to work in.
